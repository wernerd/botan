# Historically we assumed that even baremetal systems had a RTC.
# Starting in 3.7.0 this became a named feature, which can be enabled
# or disabled. It is included in the default baremetal configuration
# to avoid a confusing situation for existing users, who would
# otherwise have their clock support vanish.
#
# If your baremetal system does not have a clock you should use
# --disable-os-features=system_clock
